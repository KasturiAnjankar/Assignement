1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans: Two values of boolean data type are True and False.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans: Boolean operators are as follows:
i.	and
ii.	or
iii.	not
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans: 
True	and True is	True
True and False	is False
False and	True is	False
False	and False	is False

True	or True	is True
True 	or False	is True
False	or True	is True
False	or False is	False

not True is False
not False is True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) --> False
not (5 > 4) --> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) --> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) --> False
(True and True) and (True == False) --> False
(not False) or (not True) --> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans:
•	Less than (<)
•	Less than or equal to (<=)
•	Greater than (>)
•	Greater than or equal to (>=)
•	Equal to ( == )
•	Not equal to ( != )

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans: equal to operator is used for comparison, while assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
Ex: 	a = 10 #Assignment
b = 20 #Assignment
a == b #equals to operator and returns False

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Ans:
spam = 0
if spam == 10: 
  print('eggs') #1st block
if spam > 5:
  print('bacon')  #2nd block
else:
  print('ham')  #3rd block
print('spam')
print('spam')
 
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans:
spam=int(input("Enter a number"))
if(spam==1):
    print('Hello')
elif(spam==2):
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans: Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans: break: terminates the loop or statement(block) and control will pass to the statements that are present after the break statement.
continue: will move the execution to the start of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans: All will return same output i.e., 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
range(10): prints 0 to 9, excludes 10
range(0,10): specifies start with 0 and goes up to 10, but excluding 10.
range(0,10,1): here 0 is start and 10 is upper limit, but excluding 10 and 1 is step.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans: for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans: spam.bacon()
